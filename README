ABOUT

  pgtop is a PostgreSQL clone for `mytop', which in turn, is a `top' clone for MySQL

  pgtop is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the threads
  and overall performance of PostgreSQL 7.2+. It
  runs on most Unix systems which have Perl, DBI, and Term::ReadKey
  installed. And with Term::ANSIColor installed you even get color.

  For more detailed information, look at the `mytop' page on sourceforge.net:
  http://mytop.sourceforge.net/

WARNING

  pgtop is a quick & dirty hack over `mytop', and not all MySQL concepts map very
  well on PostgreSQL architecture and statistics collector. So don't expect a
  good quality out of this little hack... 

  And, you should probably look for `ptop'.

INSTALLATION

  tar -zxvf pgtop-<version>.tar.gz
  cd pgtop-<version>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

  There's no test, actually.

DOCUMENTATION

  man pgtop
  perldoc pgtop
